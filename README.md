# Bikeshare Analysis 

Analysis script for exploring bike share data

# Description

Using Python, I explored data produced by bike share systems for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script imports the data into a dataframe and answers interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. It takes raw input from the user to create an interactive experience in the terminal and present filtered statistics.
