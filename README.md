# Bikeshare Analysis 

Analysis script for exploring bike share data

# Description

Using Python, I explored data produced by bike share systems for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script imports the data into a dataframe and answers interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. It takes raw input from the user to create an interactive experience in the terminal and present filtered statistics.

# Getting Started

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- I reccommend using Anaconda ([install instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)). Check for dependencies by running `conda list` in terminal.

## Installing
- Fork the repo and pull to your local machine

## Using
